# Fraction class <h1>
  
  Class which creates a fraction type object, being initialized with two integer variables.
  
# Initialization <h3>
  
  The object is initialized with two variables, which will represent the value of the numerator and denominator of the fraction, respectively.
  During the initialization of the object, two of the class methods are applied: verifyType(), which verifies if both values are integer type; and
  verifyNullDen(), which verifies if the denominator is equal to zero or null. In both cases, if the conjecture is true, the program will raise an
  exception.
